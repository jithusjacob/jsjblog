I am creating a app with flutter that captures lot of input data with TextField.
So I have a lot of TextField widgets used.So instead of creating TextField for
each input I plan to create a custom TextField which can be reused  for each
input.TextFields usually will have the same look and feel for each input
throughout the app. So the best benefit of custom TextField is that if there is
change in the look of the TextField then we need to change it only at one place.
