      <description>Introduction In the flutter application I am creating I need a single place where the app theme can be added which will reflect in the whole application.This includes color,font size and other look and feel elements.This is so if any changes are required in the UI. It can be easily done at a single place.Also the text size and position of other elements should be dynamic based on the screen size for a responsive UI.</description>

      <description>Introduction So I recently upgraded to NeoVim 0.5 stable release.This release has a inbuilt LSP(Language server protocol) which is a client to LSP servers.It also includes a Lua framework for building enhanced LSP tools.&#xA;I used coc-nvim earlier as LSP client to interact with Dart LSP server which it does automatically using coc-flutter extension.If you want to know how to do that read my previous blog post for more details.</description>

      <description>So recently Neovim 0.5 version was released with in built LSP(Language Server Protocol) and Lua language support. So I modifed my init.vim with &amp;lsquo;coc-nvim&amp;rsquo; to init.lua and the in built LSP.I want to save both the config files in GitHub.I googled and found that people have dot files repository where they store all the configuration files.So I decided to follow the same approach.I used the git orphan branches to store different configuration files.</description>

      <description>Folding in vim I have started using NeoVim as my editor.So I have added lot of configurations in my init.vim file.I keep updating the same when I find some new requirements. So I wanted to manage all the configurations related to NeoVim and its Plugins. I checked various ways and found that folding was one of the methods to do that.Folding is a way of collapsing a group of lines into a single line.</description>
