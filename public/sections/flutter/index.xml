      <description>Introduction In the flutter application I am creating I need a single place where the app theme can be added which will reflect in the whole application.This includes color,font size and other look and feel elements.This is so if any changes are required in the UI. It can be easily done at a single place.Also the text size and position of other elements should be dynamic based on the screen size for a responsive UI.</description>

      <description>Introduction So I recently upgraded to NeoVim 0.5 stable release.This release has a inbuilt LSP(Language server protocol) which is a client to LSP servers.It also includes a Lua framework for building enhanced LSP tools.&#xA;I used coc-nvim earlier as LSP client to interact with Dart LSP server which it does automatically using coc-flutter extension.If you want to know how to do that read my previous blog post for more details.</description>

      <description>I recently started using Neovim as my text editor.Also right now I am learning Flutter to create a mobile application for my personal project. So I decided to setup Neovim as a Flutter IDE.With this I can practice Vim with Flutter.&#xA;Install Plugins To setup Neovim as Flutter IDE we need to use coc.nvim plugin .Also for formatting, I am using the dart_vim_plugin.We also need the snippets to be loaded like the ones for stateless/stateful widget.</description>
